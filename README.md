# Web As You Wish 
### (this project was abandoned due to the author's visual illness)
### Browser tool for creation of pure HTML/CSS webpages (works on smartphones)
#### Under construction - teaser available at https://webasyouwish.com/teaser

This tool creates webpages very fast. And the webpages are fast, reliable on any browser x device, accessibility friendly, excellent for SEO, referring to HTML semantics, non-verbose, very maintainable, lightweight, 100% respectful to the World Wide Web Consortium standards and have zero dependency on libraries. All Html elements are created by Html code (not by JavaScript).

WAYW produces single HTML files with embedded CSS (and eventual JavaScript) that **weight less than 25 kB** in average!

With WAYW you create complete webpages, without writing a single line of code. You don't need to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript, although the produced code is very readable.

WAYW can be used perfectly in a small device such as IPhone 5.
